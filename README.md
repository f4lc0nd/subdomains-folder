Welcome to the **BugBounty Subdomains** repository! This project is designed to help bug bounty hunters by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of **subdomains** for legal bug bounty programs hosted on popular bug bounty platforms.

## About the Project

Bug bounty hunters often spend a significant amount of time discovering subdomains of target domains for their assessments. While many tools and methods exist for finding subdomains, **access to an up-to-date list** of subdomains can save valuable time and provide an essential starting point for recon and exploitation.

This repository contains **publicly available subdomain lists** for all bug bounty programs that are legally authorized for security testing. It is updated regularly to ensure bug bounty hunters have the most accurate and comprehensive data at their fingertips.

### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Subdomain Data**: A curated list of subdomains across all major bug bounty platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Synack, and others.
- **Legal Programs Only**: All subdomains come from verified, legal bug bounty programs. We do not promote or endorse illegal activities.
- **Open-Source**: This repository is entirely open-source, meaning everyone can contribute and use it freely. Collaboration is highly encouraged!
- **Regular Updates**: The list is constantly maintained and updated to reflect changes and new programs.
